A context is the base element of Docm. Everything that Docm does happens within
some context. It is a required base level for documents to be created and thus
for links to be created.

This means that the first step to actually getting use out of Docm is to create
a context. Contexts are restricted to directories (folders) and all their
contained directiories. Essentially, if a context is created (see the commands
section on how to do that) in the directory '/x/y/z/', then files that are
contained within that directory can be added as documents. Note that a file in
'/x/y/z/w/' can also be created as a document, because 'w/' is a subdirectory
of 'z/'.

Commands:
    make-context   Creates a context in the current directory
    rm-context     Removes the current context

Notes:
    If somehow (eg. by manipulating the '.docm/' directory) a context is
    created in a directory that is already covered that some other context,
    then priority is given to the subdirectory's context.
