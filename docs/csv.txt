Docm provides some basic utilities to import and output documents and links.
These utilities accept and produce files in a format that resembles the CSV
format. 

Note that when a document is associated with more than one file, only one of
the files will be included.

The commands that one uses in order to create and read CSV representations of a
graph are the following:

    make-csv    Outputs the contents of the CSV file that fully represents the
                    context to stdout

    load-csv    Accepts a file name as an argument and reads that file and
                    reconstructs the context that the CSV file describes
