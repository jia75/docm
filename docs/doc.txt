'docm doc' is the monolithic command for dealing with most document-related
tasks. Executing it without any options simply creates a document with the
specified title.

Options
    -r  Remove the specified document
    -i  Add all files in the current directory to the context (not recursive)
    -f  Accept one argument and set it as a file of the document

Notes
    When multiple options are used together, the following precedence rules are
    followed: the '-f' option is always executed first, and no other options
    are executed; the '-i option is executed if no '-f' option exists, and no
    others are executed; the '-r' option is executed last in priority (because
    it is the most destructive).
