Searching is a key feature of Docm. For this reason, Docm works with a
specialized searching and filtering language that is used as input to the
search command 'docm search <query>'.

The search query is a string that contains comma separated terms.

An example is the following:

docm search ">,extends,Example Document,<,tags,Design"

This query can be split into two pieces: ">,extends,Example Document" and
"<,tags,Design". The first part says: execute the filtering command ">" with
the two following terms as arguments (which means to select only documents that
have an "extends" link to "Example Document"). Similarly, the second part:
select all documents that "Design" has a "tags" link to. Overall, this query
selects the intersection of these two sets of documents.
